### Creating project

You can create a simple project using the built-in dart command `dart create`:
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash">

```bash
$ dart create -t console-simple your-project-name && cd ./your-project-name
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell">

```ps1
> (dart create -t console-simple your-project-name) -and (cd ./your-project-name)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Replace `your-project-name` with your desired name.

This command will create few files that are needed to start a project. There will be a `pubspec.yaml` with basic project info and dependency declaration. There will also be a file created with name of your project in `bin` directory. This is the main file that you would have to run to start the bot.

<!--truncate-->

To add nyxx to your project, run `dart pub add nyxx`. Your `pubspec.yaml` file should then look similar to this:

```yml title="./pubspec.yaml"
name: test
description: A simple command-line application.
version: 1.0.0
# homepage: https://www.example.com

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.14.2 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
# highlight-next-line
  nyxx: ^3.0.0 # You may have a different version if you follow this guide 

dev_dependencies:
  lints: ^1.0.0
```

Now when if you execute the `dart pub get` command in the project's root directory, nyxx should be pulled from repos:

```
$ dart pub get

### First code

With everything set up, we can now start coding our bot, but let's start with something easy.
This is simple bot which replies to `!ping` with `pong`.

```dart title="./bin/your_project_name.dart"
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';

void main() {
  //highlight-start
  final bot = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket("TOKEN", GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged);

  bot.onMessageReceived.listen((event) {
    if (event.message.content == "!ping") {
      event.message.channel.sendMessage(MessageBuilder.content('Pong!'));
    }
  });
  //highlight-end
}
```

Let's explain what each line does:

```dart title="./bin/your_project_name.dart"
final bot = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket("TOKEN", GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged);
```

Here we are creating and starting a new client with your token and desired gateway intents.
In this case the bot will request all intents except privileged ones.

```dart
bot.onMessageReceived.listen((event) {
    if (event.message.content == "!ping") {
      event.message.channel.sendMessage(MessageBuilder.content("Pong!"));
    }
});
```

Here we are subscribing to the `onMessageReceived` stream which will 'deliver' new messages to the handler.
The function is invoked with `MessageEvent` objects which contain `Message` objects for you to use.

```dart title="./bin/your_project_name.dart"
if (event.message.content == "!ping") {
  event.message.channel.sendMessage(MessageBuilder.content("Pong!"));
}
```

Here we check if the message's content is equal to `!ping` and if it is we'll send `pong` message to the same channel. To send messages we have to access the channel which is in form of a `Cacheable` object. This is because channel might not
be cached inside client.

So, let's try out:

<PingCommand />

See? Very easy.
Now, let's look how to respond to a message.
```dart title="./bin/your_project_name.dart"
if (event.message.content == '!ping') {
  //highlight-start
  final replyBuilder = ReplyBuilder.fromMessage(event.message);

  event.message.channel.sendMessage(MessageBuilder.content('Pong!')..replyBuilder = replyBuilder);
  //highlight-end
}
```

And the result should look like this:
<PingCommandReplied ping={true} />

But the bot is mentionning when it replies, so we'll need to use the `AllowedMentions` class
```dart title="./bin/your_project_name.dart"
if (event.message.content == '!ping') {
  final replyBuilder = ReplyBuilder.fromMessage(event.message);
  //highlight-next-line
  final allowedMentions = AllowedMentions()..allow(reply: false);

  //highlight-next-line
  event.message.channel.sendMessage(MessageBuilder.content('Pong!')..replyBuilder = replyBuilder..allowedMentions = allowedMentions);
}
```
And now, if you re-execute the command, you shouldn't be mentionned when the bot replies.
Like so:

<PingCommandReplied />

<br />

That's all you need to create your first command.
