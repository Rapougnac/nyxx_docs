# Command handling

Command handling is, by definition, a way to handle commands in multiple files.
Because by creating a lot of commands, your code in your main file will start to get really big and have a if/else if/switch hell.

Unlike many other languages, Dart does **not** have a way to dynamically — only known at runtime — import files.
But don't worry, there's still a way to handle properly your commands, slash commands and legacy commands.
[`nyxx_commands`][1] is a library that can handle commands for you.

## Creation of client

Let's setup a basic example, first, we need to create our client.
```dart
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';

void main() {
  //highlight-start
  // nyxx_commands doesn't support INyxxRest yet, so we need to use INyxxWebsocket.
  final client = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket(
    '<TOKEN>',
    GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged | GatewayIntents.guildMembers,
  )..connect();
  //highlight-end
}
```
Now, by convenience, we register the basic plugins.
These aren't required for [`nyxx_commands`][1] to work
```dart
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';

void main() {
  // nyxx_commands doesn't support INyxxRest yet, so we need to use INyxxWebsocket.
  final client = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket(
    '<TOKEN>',
    GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged | GatewayIntents.guildMembers,
  );

  //highlight-start
  client
    ..registerPlugin(Logging())
    ..registerPlugin(CliIntegration())
    ..registerPlugin(IgnoreExceptions());
  //highlight-end
}
```

## Creating our `CommandsPlugin`

Ok, so now, we have client ready to be used, but we didn't used [`nyxx_commands`][1] after all. So let's get into it.
```dart
import 'package:nyxx/nyxx.dart';
//highlight-next-line
import 'package:nyxx_commands/nyxx_commands.dart';

void main() {
  // nyxx_commands doesn't support INyxxRest yet, so we need to use INyxxWebsocket.
  final client = NyxxFactory.createNyxxWebsocket(
    '<TOKEN>',
    GatewayIntents.allUnprivileged | GatewayIntents.guildMembers,
  );

  client
    ..registerPlugin(Logging())
    ..registerPlugin(CliIntegration())
    ..registerPlugin(IgnoreExceptions());

  //highlight-start
  // Next, we need to create our plugin. The plugin class used for nyxx_commands is `CommandsPlugin`
  // and we need to store it in a variable to be able to access it for registering commands and
  // converters.

  CommandsPlugin commands = CommandsPlugin(
    // The `prefix` parameter determines what prefix nyxx_commands will use for text commands.
    //
    // It isn't a simple string but a function that takes a single argument, an `IMessage`, and
    // returns a `String` indicating what prefix to use for that message. This allows you to have
    // different prefixes for different messages, for example you might want the bot to not require
    // a prefix when in direct messages. In that case, you might provide a function like this:
    // ```dart
    // prefix: (message) {
    //   if (message.startsWith('!')) {
    //     return '!';
    //   } else if (message.guild == null) {
    //     return '';
    //   }
    // }
    //```
    //
    // In this case, we always return `!` meaning that the prefix for all messages will be `!`.
    prefix: (message) => '!',

    // The `guild` parameter determines what guild slash commands will be registered to by default.
    //
    // This is useful for testing since registering slash commands globally can take up to an hour,
    // whereas registering commands for a single guild is instantaneous.
    //
    // If you aren't testing or want your commands to be registered globally, either omit this
    // parameter or set it to `null`.
    guild: Snowflake(Platform.environment['GUILD']!),

    // The `options` parameter allows you to specify additional configuration options for the
    // plugin.
    //
    // Generally you can just omit this parameter and use the defaults, but if you want to allow for
    // a specific behaviour you can include this parameter to change the default settings.
    //
    // In this case, we set the option `logErrors` to `true`, meaning errors that occur in commands
    // will be sent to the logger. If you have also added the `Logging` plugin to your client, these
    // will then be printed to your console.
    // `true` is actually the default for this option and was included here for the sake of example.
    options: CommandsOptions(
      logErrors: true,
    ),
  );

  // Next, we add the commands plugin to our client:
  client.registerPlugin(commands);


  // Finally, we tell the client to connect to Discord:
  client.connect();
  //highlight-end
}
```

## Registering  a command

To register a command, we must first create an instance of the `Command` class.
This class represents a single command, slash command or not, and once added to the bot will
automatically be ready to use.

For our first command, let's create the famous `ping` command that'll reply with `pong`.

The first parameter is the command name.
Command names must obey certain rules, if they don't an error will be thrown.
Generally, using lower case letters dashes (`-`) instead of spaces or undersoces will avoid any problems.
<br />
The second parameter is the command description.
In traditional command frameworks, command descriptions aren't required. However, Discord
requires that all slash commands have a description, so it is needed in nyxx_commands. 
<br />
The third parameter is the function that will be executed when the command is ran.

The first parameter to this function must be a `Context`. 

A `Context` allows you to access various information about how the command was run: the user that executed it, the guild it was ran in and a few other useful pieces of information.
`Context` also has a couple of methods that make it easier to respond to commands.
Since a ping command doesn't have any other arguments, we don't add any other parameters to the function.

```dart
// Finally, we tell the client to connect to Discord:
client.connect();

//highlight-start
ChatCommand ping = ChatCommand(
  'ping',
  'Checks if the bot\'s online',
  (IContext context) {
    // For a ping command, all we need to do is respond with `pong`.
    // To do that, we can use the `Context`'s `respond` method which responds to the command with
    // a message.
    context.respond(MessageBuilder.content('pong!'));
  },
);
//highlight-end
```

### Adding a command to the `CommandsPlugin`

Once we've created our command, we need to add it to our bot.

The commands on a bot can be represented with a parent-child tree that looks like this:

```
client
┗━ ping
```

```dart
commands.addCommand(ping);
```

At this point, if you run this file, you should see a slash command named "ping" appear in
Discord. Executing it should make the bot send `pong!` to the channel the command was executed
in.
You can also send a text message starting with `!ping` and  you should see a similar result.

Here's an example:
<BaseCommand commandContent="!ping" isCommand={true} author="rapougnac">pong!</BaseCommand>
